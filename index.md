我目前为大连理工大学软件工程博士在读（预计2027毕业），导师为[樊鑫教授](https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/Xin_Fan/zh_CN/index.htm)；2023年获重庆邮电大学计算机技术硕士学位，导师为[高新波教授](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/xbgao/)与[冷佳旭教授](https://faculty.cqupt.edu.cn/lengjiaxu/zh_CN/index.htm)。研究方向聚焦计算机视觉与医学图像处理，主要包括医学图像分割与配准，以及图像/视频超分辨率。已在 CVPR、AAAI、ACM MM、TNNLS、IEEE BIBM Workshop 等会议/期刊发表或录用论文，并在推进 CVPR 、 MICCAI 、TMI投稿工作。<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">诚邀本科生、研究生共赴探索之旅。</span>

# About Me
---

I am a Ph.D. student in Software Engineering at Dalian University of Technology (expected 2027), supervised by [Prof. Xin Fan](https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/Xin_Fan/zh_CN/index.htm). I received my M.Sc. degree in Computer Technology from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Xinbo Gao](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/xbgao/) and [Prof. Jiaxu Leng](https://faculty.cqupt.edu.cn/lengjiaxu/zh_CN/index.htm). My research interests include Computer Vision and Medical Image Processing, with a focus on medical image segmentation and registration, as well as image/video super-resolution. I have published/accepted papers in venues such as CVPR, AAAI, ACM MM, TNNLS, and IEEE BIBM Workshop, and I am currently working on submissions to CVPR and ICME. <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Join us in exploration! Invitation for undergraduate and graduate research collaborators.</span>

<!-- I am currently an Assistant Professor with the [Visual Computing Research Center (VCC)](https://vcc.tech/index.html) (headed by [Prof. Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang)) at the [College of Computer Science & Software Engineering](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/), Shenzhen University. I received my Ph.D. in Information and Communication Engineering from Xidian University in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Xinbo Gao](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/xbgao/). Prior to that, I received my B.E. from the School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University in 2017.  -->

My research interest  is computer vision, medical image analysis, currently with medical image segmentation and foundation model.
